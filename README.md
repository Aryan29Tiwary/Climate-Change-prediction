This project focuses on predicting climate change indicators using machine learning techniques by analyzing historical environmental data such as temperature, COâ‚‚ levels, sea-level rise, and global emissions. It uses data preprocessing, feature selection, and regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM) to forecast future trends and highlight the severity of climate change over time. The system provides visualizations for better interpretability and aims to support climate awareness and policy-making by providing accurate, data-driven insights. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in addressing global environmental challenges through predictive modeling and analysis. {user_prediction[0]}")![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d63cf0d-3455-4f8c-be6d-c76798428e36)
